# Fireball Castle

## Theme
Growth

## Assets Used
- Kenney Particle Pack: https://www.kenney.nl/assets/particle-pack

## TODO
- Call `rooms_clear` if making multiple levels https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_roommanager.html#class-roommanager-method-rooms-clear
- Bigger spells should do more damage and area damage
- Make it necessary to jump and shoot spell at height peak to damage certain monsters (cyclops perhaps?)
- Make fireball smoke scale with spell power (in additional to the ball part of the fireball)
   - Add smoke trail
   - https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/327
- Make lanterns (omni light objects in a rooms) where you shoot fire ball at lantern to make room light up (omni light visibility from off to on)
- Fireballs explode upon impact (closer to explosion center more damage)
- Add animations
   - Wizard hands move forward to conjure fireballs
- Left and right area of game screen use for health and mana display and score or other UI
- Leash monsters in their rooms so monsters cannot escape from their rooms
- Mana should drain faster if you keep charging up max strength fireball without shooting it (to discourage always having one charging)
- Add platforming challenges where if you fall in poison or spikes you take damage and need to jump on platforms to avoid damage
- Prevent player from leaving room until enemies have been cleared out
- Enemies should only start moving after player enters room area
